Python was created as a successor of a language called ABC (All Basic Code) and 
released publicly in1991. Guido remains Pythonâ€™s principal author, although it 
includes many contributions from active user community.
Between 1991 and 2001 there are several versions released, current stable release is 
3.2. In 2001 the Python Software Foundation (PSF) was formed, a non-profit 
organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope 
Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.
